SETUP.EXE installs DECDATA, its associated data files, and places the
DECDATA icon on the desktop. The default folder for the installation is
C:\ICRP07 however you can select or define a different folder. Accept the
defaults on any remaining questions. The installation will end with this
file being displayed and DECDATA invoked. The user guide can be viewed within
DECDATA by pressing the F6 key and selecting the guide. DECDATA can be
removed from the system by clicking the executable UNINS000.EXE in the folder
in which DECDATA was installed.

I. Some Advice

a. Networks.

This software is not intended to reside on a network. It should be installed
on individual machines.
   
b. Vista Operating System.
   
Do not install the software under the Programs Files folder. It can be
installed in any other folder on the disk, e.g., C:My Programs or C:ICRP07.
   
The software should be installed by the "administrator". If this is not 
possible, then after completing the installation, right click on the DECDATA
desktop icon, click on Properties, select the Compatibility tab, and under
Privilege Level click "Run this program as an administrator." It is, however, 
best if the software is installed by the "administrator."
   

II. Configuration Issues

a. DECDATA Console Size.

The size of the DECDATA console window can be changed by selecting a different
font size. To do this right click on the DECDATA icon on the desktop, select
Properties, click on the Font tab, and then select the font size. A different 
font type can be selected, e.g., Lucinda Console font is a good alternative to 
the default font because of its horizontal-vertical aspect ratio. It will be
necessary to experiment here as the ultimate font size depends somewhat on 
the resolution of the monitor. So start small (e.g., Lucinda Console size 14) 
and move to larger sizes if so desired.

b. Size of DPlotJr's screen.

As installed, DPlotJr starts maximized. The display can be re-sized in the
usual manner for Windows applications; with the mouse drag a corner of the
display. After the display is of the desired size, pull down the Options menu 
on the DPlotJr's toolbar, click on General (last item), and un-select 
"Always start maximized'. DPlotJr will then start at this size in the future.

c. Plot Display. 

If DPlotJr is to create more than one plot, DECDATA directs that the plots
be displayed in a cascade manner. DECDATA will directed that the plots be 
maximizes in the plot window if a file named DPlotJr.INI is place in the DATA
folder. This can be an empty file as DECDATA only tests for the file existence.
To view the plots use the Windows menu on DPlotJr's toolbar.

d. Display of Documents/Files

During a DECDATA session, files created in the OUTPUT folder and documents 
in the REPORT folder can be displayed. The display of these files is based 
on the user having designated files with extension TXT for display by 
MS NotePad (or an ASCII editor) and files with extension PDF displayed by 
Adobe Reader.

III. Content of CD

For information on the content of the CD see CONTENT.PDF. A copy of this document
can be found in the REPORT folder (access from DECDATA by Help, F6 key) on the
CD.
